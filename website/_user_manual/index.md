# User Manual

## Getting a user account
In order to use Rodan Client you will need an account on the Rodan server the client is associated with. You can contact the server administrator directly if you know their contact info, or contact the Rodan Client administrator.

## Projects, Resources, and Workflows
The three most important concepts to understand in Rodan are **Projects**, **Resources**, and **Workflows**.

* **Project**: A Project is simply a high-level container that holds things such as your Resources, Workflows, and other associated items.
* **Resource**: A Resource is anything that you wish to process in a Workflow. They are also the results of Workflows. Resources are individual files with metadata such as a name, date of creation, and type.
* **Workflow**: A Workflow is a sequence of tasks where the output of one task will be used as the input of another task. If the output of a task is not used as the input of another task that output is considered the result of running that Workflow. The input and output of all tasks are Resources.



For example, suppose you have a simple text file - let's call it `example.txt` - and you want to count how many words
