# User Manual

## Getting a user account
In order to use Rodan Client you will need an account on the Rodan server the client is associated with. You can contact the server administrator directly if you know their contact info, or contact the Rodan Client administrator.

## Projects, Resources, Jobs, and Workflows
The most important concepts to understand in Rodan are **Projects**, **Resources**, **Jobs**, and **Workflows**.

* **Project**: A Project is simply a high-level container that holds things such as your Resources, Workflows, and other associated items.
* **Resource**: A Resource is anything that you wish to process in a Workflow. They are also the results of Workflows. Resources are individual files with metadata such as a name, date of creation, and type.
* **Job**: A Job represents a single task that produces a Resource as output.
* **Workflow**: A Workflow is a sequence of Jobs where the output of one Job will be used as the input of another Job. If the output of a Job is not used as the input of another Job that output is considered the result of running that Workflow.
